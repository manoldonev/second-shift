# Changelog

All notable changes to the second-shift marketplace. Versions are per-plugin (`plugins/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`);
this file tracks the marketplace release. `configVersion` stays `const 1` — v2 is fully backward-compatible for a
consumer with an empty config; the migration notes below are only for consumers using the changed features.

## v2.0.0 — "the extensible core"

The de-orged, extensible core: a genuinely generic marketplace + the Extension Contract v1. Semver-major.

### Extension Contract v1 (all optional; defaults reproduce v1 behavior byte-for-byte)
- **EP-1 `stageParams`** — stage-prose constants promoted to config (`planFilePattern`, `requiredLabels`,
  `visualCapture{baseUrl,devServerCommand,smokeRoutes,viewports,triggerGlobs}`, `formatGlob`). New lockstep
  validator `check-config-shadowing.sh` guards against a published-but-unread key.
- **EP-2 `commands.<repo>.extraLanes`** — additive, blocking verify lanes; run after the SUITE trio, `when`-glob
  gated, results under namespaced `ext:<name>` keys, `failureClass` from the existing closed taxonomy. No advisory mode.
- **EP-3 extension-file manifest + `check-extensions.sh`** — fail-closed lint of `.claude/second-shift/` against a
  shipped manifest (a typo'd `blocker-mutants.md.md` is loud). Companion/repo-local extensions declared in a
  `.known-extensions` allowlist.
- **EP-4 named-agent `modelOverrides`** — the mutation executor is now the logical agent `mutation-executor`,
  its tier overridable via `reviewers.modelOverrides`. `check-model-tiers.sh` asserts the lookup.
- **EP-5 companion packs** — the org-overlay distribution contract (two-pin model, namespaced agents/workflows,
  `.known-extensions` vendoring). See `docs/extending.md`.
- **EP-6 `stageWorkflows`** — register a blocking Workflow as a gate-owned stage sub-step; new closed reason
  `ext-workflow-failed`; `ext:`-namespaced state only. **EP-7 `implementDelegates`** — route Stage-5 work items to
  a delegate agent; output flows through the unchanged scope + downstream gates.
- **EP-8 `planGates`** — additive Stage-4 plan-review gates: register a plan-reviewer agent that runs after the
  built-in plan gates; additive-only (a `block` maps to `plan-reviewer-block`, never waives a gate). Completes the
  additive-gate symmetry: `planGates` (Stage 4) · `extraLanes` (Stage 6) · `reviewers.add` (Stage 8).
- New consumer guide **`docs/extending.md`**; `extension-points.md` is its field reference; the disposition test
  is codified in `context-model.md`.

### Design-provider axis (breaking)
- **`gates.figma` → top-level `design: { provider: "figma" | "claude-design" }`** (key absent = design fidelity off).
  The **figma** adapter is now internalized as a first-class provider (Stage 1/3/4/5/8), no longer consumer glue.

### De-org: removals (capabilities move, they don't disappear)
- **`skills/playwright-cli` removed** from design-toolkit → restore repo-local under `.claude/skills/playwright-cli/`.
- **api-test tier removed** (`api-test-{coder,reviewer,plan-reviewer}` + `api-testing` skill + `api-tests.mjs` +
  `gates.apiTests`) → re-attach as a companion pack via EP-6/EP-7 + `.known-extensions`.

### Genericization (stack specifics move to `review-context.md`)
- **db-reviewer** engine-agnostic (relational + document stores); **pipeline-reviewer** queue-agnostic;
  **performance / complexity / maintainability / test-coverage** reviewers stack-neutral; **design-faithful**
  reads its stack from `design-tokens`; **intake-toolkit** honors `tracker.type` (github default + jira deltas).
- `plugin.json` corrected: design-faithful / figma-faithful are the **claude-design / figma provider adapters**
  (dropped the false "(generic)" label on design-faithful).

### Fixes
- **`paths.plansDir` is now honored** by Stage 3 (was published but ignored — the config-drift defect).
- Base-branch, format-glob, viewport, and label constants routed through config (EP-1) instead of hardcoded.
- De-anonymization: removed a shipped private-repo inventory, real GitHub App identifiers, and domain-fingerprint
  substance from the stock and its examples.

### v1 → v2 migration (consumers)
1. Bump the marketplace `ref` and each `plugin.json` version pin to `v2.0.0`.
2. **`gates.figma: true` → `design: { provider: "figma" }`** — **except** a Claude-Design (DesignSync) shop, which
   is **`design: { provider: "claude-design" }`** (the old `gates.figma` flag did not imply figma).
3. **`gates.apiTests`**: remove; carry the api-test tier as a companion pack / repo-local agents+workflow and wire
   it via `implementDelegates` + `stageWorkflows`, declaring `api-testing/*.md` in `.claude/second-shift/.known-extensions`.
4. If you relied on `design-toolkit:playwright-cli`, restore it repo-local under `.claude/skills/playwright-cli/`.
5. Declare your stack in `.claude/second-shift/review-context.md` (database engine/ORM, queue broker, FE stack,
   toolchain) so the now-generic reviewers keep their prior review depth.
6. If you set `paths.plansDir`, note it is now honored — plans move to that directory.

# lean-gate-selftest.sh — behavioral suite for the run-lean milestone gates.
#
# Every case drives the REAL lean-gate.sh against a throwaway git tree and a synthetic config,
# through the script's documented seams (LEAN_PROGRESS_FILE, SECOND_SHIFT_CONFIG, --pr-file,
# --comments-file). Zero network.
#
# The cases that matter most are the ones a plausible-looking implementation gets wrong:
#   (b*) the D-41 append rules — a passing gate must append at most ONE `satisfied` line ever,
#        or diagnostic re-runs silently inflate the fix-budget counter.
#   (c*) the D-19 hard stop — 3 attempts, the 4th red exits 4.
#   (e*) AC-9's MUTUAL non-prefix-match. A one-directional reading passes with a derived
#        prefix of `lean/`, which would make every pipeline PR applicable to the lean gate.
#   (g)  G-2 — `satisfied` is a RECORD, not a CACHE. `all` must re-evaluate a milestone that
#        already has a satisfied line, or a green gate from before a fix round certifies code
#        that never passed it.
#
# Exit code = number of failed checks (repo selftest convention).
